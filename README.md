# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data

This project involves the extraction and analysis of stock data for two companies, Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). The primary tools used are the `yfinance` library for retrieving historical stock data and web scraping techniques for extracting revenue data.

The analysis begins with the extraction of Tesla's historical stock data using `yfinance`. The data is processed, including index resetting, and the initial rows are displayed. Subsequently, revenue data for Tesla is extracted through web scraping methods.

The project extends its analysis to GameStop, using `yfinance` to acquire historical stock data and web scraping to gather revenue data. Similar to the Tesla analysis, the results are displayed to provide insights into GameStop's financial performance.

The final phase of the project involves visualizing the Tesla stock data. A custom `make_graph` function is employed to create a graphical representation of the stock's historical performance. The resulting graph is titled to enhance interpretability.

Throughout the project, a combination of `yfinance` and web scraping techniques is employed to create a comprehensive analysis of the stock data for both Tesla and GameStop. Visualizations and dataframes are utilized to present the findings, offering a detailed exploration of the financial performance of the two companies.
